# Junior Product Designer Code Challenge

At many companies, product design is split into different roles: UX, UI, front-end development, etc. At Workforce.com, it’s all one role. Our designers are generalists that design 'in medium'. This means you’ll spend less time in design programs, and more time making your designs functional with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
